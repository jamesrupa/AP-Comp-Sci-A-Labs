**AP Computer Science A Lab**\
*Created By James Rupa*

## Project Description

This was just a lab assignment for the AP Computer Science A class where we had to code multiple class given the parameters that were given to us. I will include these in the inital folder with the Main runner file that was given to us to test the code. Nothing hard here, just wanted to upload it to GitHub and keep track of it.

## How To Use The Project

For inital files go to --> inital folder\
For edited/source files go to --> src folder

## Future Plans

* Finish up SymptAid Response
* Start another java project
* Create a Java game

## Acknowledgments
