# Magpie Lab
**AP Computer Science A Lab**\
*Created By James Rupa*

## Project Description

Currently in the AP Computer Science A curriculum this is Lab #1 that we started to work on. The Magpie Lab has five activities that range from trying a ChatBot to changing the Magpie classes to modifying the Magpie classes. The Magpie Lab introduces the concept of Natural Language Processing, in a very simplified way. This project contains each of the folders that range from Activities 2 - 4. 

## How To Use The Project

This project is fairly simple to use but might be complicated to understand. Each folder contains a different activity in the lab. The following activites correspond to the folder to complete the assignment.
* Activity 2 --> MagPie2
* Activity 3 --> MagPie3
* Activity 4 --> MagPie4

Go to folder of activity --> src --> code

When you have found which activity that you want to use the files are included which had already been altered to finish the assignment in the lab. For further instructions or reference go here --> http://2014-15.s3.amazonaws.com/Labs/Magpie/MagpieLabStudentGuide_updated_2014_Final.pdf

## Future Plans

Being able to make a decent Chatbot of my own without the help of others or using code and just altering it. With this I would also want the chatbot to not be through the terminal but rather create an application with a GUI to make it more appealing for people.
